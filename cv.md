    <p class="info-box-title">HOBBIES AND INTERESTS</p>
    <p class="info-box-content cv-card">I enjoy learning and improving my web development skills, adapting to new frameworks and design ideas. When away from the computer screen, you can catch me on a nice long bike ride through the British countryside or out with those closest to me.<br>3D Printing is another of my hobbies - with my own 3D printer at my desk I love designing an item (using Fusion 360) and then being able to make it a matter of feet away from me.</p>
