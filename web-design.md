Get a professional quality website for a fraction of the price you'd normally have to pay. I offer creation of websites using many different platforms or frameworks - read below to see which is most suitable for your use case.

<div>
<a href="/web-design/wordpress/">
<div class="info-box post-list">
    <p class="info-box-title">WORDPRESS</p>
    <p class="info-box-content">Wordpress is a CMS which comes with an admin panel and rich plugin repository. If you are planning on customising your site very often consider this as a choice. May be slower than other options. Click for more info.</p>
</div>
</a>

<a href="/web-design/jekyll/">
<div class="info-box post-list">
    <p class="info-box-title">JEKYLL</p>
    <p class="info-box-content">Jekyll is a revolutionary type of site which requires much less resources to host than WordPress and offers a middle ground between having a pure HTML site and a WordPress site. This is also another great choice if you are planning to use the site for something like a blog, where pages are regularly updated and added. Much faster than WordPress. Click for more info.</p>

<a href="/web-design/static/">
<div class="info-box post-list">
    <p class="info-box-title">'HARD CODED' SITE</p>
    <p class="info-box-content">Get your website the traditional way - a simple collection of HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. Recommended for those who do not need their site to be updated regularly. Much Faster than WordPress. Click for more info.</p>
